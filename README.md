# network traffic analysis

## Description

This repository contains hands-on practice for capturing and analyzing network
traffic using tools such as `nmap`, `tcpdump`, and `Wireshark`.

The main focus of this project is to understand how network traffic flows,
how open ports are identified, and how basic network behavior can be analyzed
within a **legal and controlled local environment**.

This project does NOT focus on exploitation.
It focuses on **analysis, observation, and documentation**.

## Objectives
- Capture network traffic in a local lab environment
- Analyze traffic flow and protocol behavior
- Understand open ports and basic network exposure
- Practice documenting technical findings clearly

## Tools
- Nmap
- Tcpdump
- Wireshark
- Linux 
- Local lab environment (local network)
- Networking
